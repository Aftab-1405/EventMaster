# 🎉 Event Management System with SMS Reminders

## 📝 Overview

The **Event Management System** is a web-based platform designed to simplify the organization and management of events. It integrates a powerful SMS reminder system using **Twilio** to send notifications to attendees, ensuring everyone is reminded in time. Whether it's a conference, a workshop, or a social gathering, this system helps event organizers manage their attendees effortlessly and ensures that no one forgets about upcoming events.

## 🤔 Why This System?

In today’s fast-paced world, managing events efficiently is crucial to their success. Organizers often face challenges like:

- 📅 Keeping track of event details.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Managing RSVPs and attendee information.
- 📲 Sending timely reminders to ensure maximum attendance.

This system addresses these challenges by:

- Automating attendee management.
- Ensuring timely SMS reminders, reducing the risk of attendees forgetting about the event.
- Providing an easy-to-use platform for both organizers and attendees.

## 💡 The Idea Behind This Project

The idea is simple: to reduce the manual workload involved in event management and make sure attendees are always updated about event details. By integrating SMS reminders, this system ensures attendees receive personalized reminders on their phones, a much more direct and reliable communication method than emails or other forms of notifications.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 🎟️ 1. Event Creation

Organizers can create an event by providing key details such as the event name, description, date, and venue. This information is saved in the system and can be viewed later.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 2. RSVP System

Attendees can RSVP for events by submitting their names and mobile numbers. The system stores this information securely and links it to the respective event.

### 📲 3. SMS Reminders

Before the event date, organizers can send SMS reminders to all registered attendees. The reminder includes event details like date, time, and venue, helping attendees stay informed.

### 👥 4. Viewing Attendees

Organizers can easily access a list of attendees who have RSVP'd, making it easy to keep track of who’s attending.

### 📜 5. Activity Logging

Every action performed in the system—whether it's event creation, RSVP submissions, or sending reminders—is logged. This helps organizers maintain a clear overview of their event's status and attendee engagement.

## 🎯 Benefits of Using This System
